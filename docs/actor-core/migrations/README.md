## Technical Highlights

### Lock-Free Cache Implementation
```rust
use dashmap::DashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;

pub struct LockFreeL1Cache {
    cache: DashMap<String, CacheEntry>,
    max_size: usize,
    stats: Arc<CacheStats>,
}
```

### Async Aggregator
```rust
#[async_trait]
impl Aggregator for AsyncAggregator {
    async fn resolve(&self, actor: &Actor) -> Result<Snapshot> {
        // Concurrent subsystem processing
        let mut join_set = JoinSet::new();
        for subsystem in subsystems {
            join_set.spawn(async move {
                subsystem.contribute(&actor).await
            });
        }
        // Collect and aggregate results
    }
}
```

### Type-Safe Error Handling
```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum ActorCoreError {
    #[error("Invalid actor: {0}")]
    InvalidActor(String),
    #[error("Subsystem error: {0}")]
    SubsystemError(String),
    // ... more error types
}
```

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
dashmap = "5.0"
crossbeam = "0.8"
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
```

### Development Dependencies
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.5"
proptest = "1.0"
cargo-fuzz = "0.11"
```

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- âœ… **Throughput**: 3x improvement (150K ops/sec)
- âœ… **Latency**: 60% reduction (3ms p99)
- âœ… **Memory**: 40% reduction (600MB)
- âœ… **CPU**: 50% reduction

### Quality Targets
- âœ… **Zero Memory Leaks**: Rust ownership system
- âœ… **Zero Data Races**: Rust type system
- âœ… **100% Test Coverage**: Maintained throughout
- âœ… **API Compatibility**: 100% backward compatible

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Memory Management**: Rust's ownership system provides compile-time guarantees
- **Concurrency**: Rust's type system prevents data races at compile time
- **Performance**: Continuous benchmarking ensures targets are met
- **API Compatibility**: Strict versioning and comprehensive testing

### Project Risks
- **Timeline**: Incremental migration with parallel development
- **Team Skills**: Comprehensive Rust training program
- **Testing**: Multiple testing strategies (unit, integration, property-based)
- **Rollback**: Keep Go version running in parallel

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (1.75+)
- Go 1.21+ (for comparison testing)
- Docker (for containerized testing)
- Kubernetes (for deployment testing)

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install additional tools
cargo install cargo-make cargo-fuzz cargo-criterion

# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd actor-core-rust
```

### 3. Development Workflow
```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Run fuzz testing
cargo fuzz run <target>

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint code
cargo clippy
```
