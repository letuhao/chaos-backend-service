# Coverage Criteria and Targets

## Target Coverage Goals (Sane Gates)

### Primary Targets
- **Lines: 80-90%** (start at 80%, ratchet +2% occasionally)
- **Branches: 60-75%** (harder to push; prioritize critical modules)
- **Functions: 90%** (cheap win—ensure every public fn has at least one call)

### Current Status (as of latest coverage run with branch coverage enabled)
- **Lines: 63.72%** (7056/11074) - **IMPROVING** ⬆️ (+5.17%)
- **Branches: 45.94%** (249/542) - **GOOD** ✅ (within target range 60-75%)
- **Functions: 58.29%** (872/1496) - **IMPROVING** ⬆️ (+3.88%)

### Critical Files Status (Priority Order)
1. `cache.rs` - **80.00%** (64/80 functions, 75.32% lines) - **COMPLETED** ✅
2. `cache/multi_layer.rs` - **0.00%** (0/80 functions, 0% lines) - **PENDING** ⏳
3. `production.rs` - **48.84%** (21/43 functions, 79.31% lines) - **IMPROVED** 🔄
4. `registry.rs` - **23.08%** (12/52 functions, 31.48% lines) - **PARTIAL** 🔄
5. `services.rs` - **32.65%** (16/49 functions, 35.07% lines) - **PARTIAL** 🔄
6. `performance/benchmarks.rs` - **0.00%** (0/23 functions, 0% lines) - **PENDING** ⏳

### Files with Good Coverage (Keep Maintained)
- `constants.rs` - 100% ✅
- `enums.rs` - 100% ✅ (100% branch coverage)
- `interfaces.rs` - 100% ✅
- `production.rs` - 100% branch coverage ✅

### Branch Coverage Explanation
**Why we initially saw 0% branches:**
- Branch coverage requires the **nightly Rust toolchain** (`cargo +nightly llvm-cov --branch`)
- The `--branch` flag is **unstable** and not enabled by default
- Without the nightly toolchain, LLVM coverage only reports line and function coverage

**Current branch coverage status:**
- **45.94%** (249/542 branches) - Good progress toward 60-75% target
- Some files have excellent branch coverage:
  - `enums.rs`: 100% (2/2 branches)
  - `production.rs`: 100% (14/14 branches)
  - `bucket_processor.rs`: 87.50% (14/16 branches)
- Files needing branch coverage improvement:
  - `cache.rs`: 62.00% (31/50 branches)
  - `performance/simd.rs`: 66.67% (16/24 branches)
  - `pools/memory_pools.rs`: 58.82% (20/34 branches)

### Files with Good Coverage (Keep Maintained)
- `constants.rs` - 100% ✅
- `enums.rs` - 100% ✅ (100% branch coverage)
- `interfaces.rs` - 100% ✅
- `production.rs` - 100% branch coverage ✅
- `integration_tests.rs` - 100% ✅

### Action Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Add comprehensive tests to 0% coverage files
2. **Phase 2**: Focus on Functions (target: 90%) - easiest wins
3. **Phase 3**: Focus on Lines (target: 80-90%) - comprehensive coverage
4. **Phase 4**: Focus on Branches (target: 60-75%) - critical path coverage

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Functions: ≥90% (currently 54.41%)
- [ ] Lines: ≥80% (currently 58.55%)
- [ ] Branches: ≥60% (currently 0%)
- [ ] All critical modules have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] No files with 0% coverage remain
